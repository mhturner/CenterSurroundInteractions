# CenterSurroundInteractions
Analysis and modeling code for "Receptive field center-surround interactions mediate context-dependent spatial contrast encoding in the retina"

This analysis code depends on my general analysis package from my time in the RiekeLab, MHT-analysis (https://github.com/mhturner/MHT-analysis) and uses riekesuite to load raw data. If you would like any dependent code (e.g. riekesuite) or the raw data that went into the paper, please reach out to me. Likewise if you spot any errors please let me know.
